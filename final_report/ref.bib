  abstract   = {Light-weight convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the de-facto for mobile vision tasks. Their spatial inductive biases allow them to learn representations with fewer parameters across different vision tasks. However, these networks are spatially local. To learn global representations, self-attention-based vision transformers (ViTs) have been adopted. Unlike CNNs, ViTs are heavyweight. In this paper, we ask the following question: is it possible to combine the strengths of CNNs and ViTs to build a light-weight and low latency network for mobile vision tasks? Towards this end, we introduce MobileViT, a light-weight and general-purpose vision transformer for mobile devices. MobileViT presents a different perspective for the global processing of information with transformers. Our results show that MobileViT signiÔ¨Åcantly outperforms CNNand ViT-based networks across different tasks and datasets. On the ImageNet-1k dataset, MobileViT achieves top-1 accuracy of 78.4\% with about 6 million parameters, which is 3.2\% and 6.2\% more accurate than MobileNetv3 (CNN-based) and DeIT (ViT-based) for a similar number of parameters. On the MS-COCO object detection task, MobileViT is 5.7\% more accurate than MobileNetv3 for a similar number of parameters.

Inspired by the strong translation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) that are trained on extensive multilingual text corpora, we aim to harness off-the-shelf LLMs to handle SLT. In this paper, we regularize the sign videos to embody linguistic characteristics of spoken language, and propose a novel SignLLM framework to transform sign videos into a language-like representation for improved readability by off-the-shelf LLMs. SignLLM comprises two key modules: (1) The Vector-Quantized Visual Sign module converts sign videos into a sequence of discrete characterlevel sign tokens, and (2) the Codebook Reconstruction and Alignment module converts these character-level tokens into word-level sign representations using an optimal transport formulation. A sign-text alignment loss further bridges the gap between sign and text tokens, enhancing semantic compatibility. We achieve state-of-the-art gloss-free results on two widely-used SLT benchmarks.},

To accomplish this, we utilise a two-pathway SlowFast network, where each pathway operates at distinct temporal resolutions to separately capture spatial (hand shapes, facial expressions) and dynamic (movements) information. In addition, we introduce two distinct feature fusion methods, carefully designed for the characteristics of CSLR: (1) Bi-directional Feature Fusion (BFF), which facilitates the transfer of dynamic semantics into spatial semantics and vice versa; and (2) Pathway Feature Enhancement (PFE), which enriches dynamic and spatial representations through auxiliary subnetworks, while avoiding the need for extra inference time. As a result, our model further strengthens spatial and dynamic representations in parallel. We demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms the current state-of-the-art performance on popular CSLR datasets, including PHOENIX14, PHOENIX14-T, and CSL-Daily.},

We show that this reliance on CNNs is not necessary and a pure transformer applied directly to sequences of image patches can perform very well on image classification tasks. When pre-trained on large amounts of data and transferred to multiple mid-sized or small image recognition benchmarks (ImageNet, CIFAR-100, VTAB, etc.), Vision Transformer (ViT) attains excellent results compared to state-of-the-art convolutional networks while requiring substantially fewer computational resources to train.},

  abstract  = {Human body trajectories are a salient cue to identify actions in the video. Such body trajectories are mainly conveyed by hands and face across consecutive frames in sign language. However, current methods in continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) usually process frames independently, thus failing to capture cross-frame trajectories to effectively identify a sign. To handle this limitation, we propose correlation network (CorrNet) to explicitly capture and leverage body trajectories across frames to identify signs. In specific, a correlation module is first proposed to dynamically compute correlation maps between the current frame and adjacent frames to identify trajectories of all spatial patches. An identification module is then presented to dynamically emphasize the body trajectories within these correlation maps. As a result, the generated features are able to gain an overview of local temporal movements to identify a sign. Thanks to its special attention on body trajectories, CorrNet achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy on four large-scale datasets, i.e., PHOENIX14, PHOENIX14-T, CSL-Daily, and CSL. A comprehensive comparison with previous spatial-temporal reasoning methods verifies the effectiveness of CorrNet. Visualizations demonstrate the effects of CorrNet on emphasizing human body trajectories across adjacent frames.},

While common implementations of these algorithms employ L\$\_2\$ regularization (often calling it "weight decay" in what may be misleading due to the inequivalence we expose), we propose a simple modification to recover the original formulation of weight decay regularization by {\textbackslash}emph\{decoupling\} the weight decay from the optimization steps taken w.r.t. the loss function. We provide empirical evidence that our proposed modification (i) decouples the optimal choice of weight decay factor from the setting of the learning rate for both standard SGD and Adam and (ii) substantially improves Adam's generalization performance, allowing it to compete with SGD with momentum on image classification datasets (on which it was previously typically outperformed by the latter).

  abstract  = {Transformer-based architectures are adopted in many continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) works for sequence modeling due to their strong capability of extracting global contexts. However, since vanilla self-attention (SA), the core module of Transformer, computes a weighted average over all time steps, the local temporal semantics of sign videos may not be fully exploited. In this work, we propose local context-aware selfattention (LCSA) to enhance the vanilla SA to leverage both local and global contexts. We introduce the local contexts at two different levels of model computation: score and query levels. At the score level, we modulate the attention scores explicitly with an additional Gaussian bias. At the query level, local contexts are modeled implicitly using depth-wise temporal convolutional networks (DTCNs). However, the vanilla Gaussian bias has two major shortcomings: first, its window size is fixed and needs to be fine-tuned laboriously; second, the fixed window size is common among all time steps. In this work, a dynamic Gaussian bias is further proposed to address the above issues. Experimental results on two benchmarks, PHOENIX-2014 and CSL, validate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.},
